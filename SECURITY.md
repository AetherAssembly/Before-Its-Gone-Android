# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the current release and the two most recent major versions.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.x | ✅ Active support (current) |
| < 1.0 | ❌ Pre-release / not supported |

As new versions are released, this table will be updated to reflect the current support window. Versions that fall outside the two-major-version window enter deprecated status and are acknowledged but no longer actively patched. Versions older than that are archived to cold storage. Retrieval of archived versions is available as a paid service; contact us at [support@aetherassembly.org](mailto:support@aetherassembly.org) for details.
